Welcome to this Archiso.

1. run the oh-my-zsh script to install zsh themes if you so desire..
2. perform your install and run the pacstrap script to install all the required dependencies for the later install, and create a new user with administrative rights (usermod -aG wheel,input,adm,sys,power,... user)
3. copy the copy-me folder into the new user's directory before arch-chrooting your new OS and finishing the install.

4. Once you're done installing your new system, reboot, log in as the newly created user and run the playbook script!
